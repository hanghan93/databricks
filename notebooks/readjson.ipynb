Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.

Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.

You can walk everywhere... for coffee, for groceries, for a night out, for breathtaking views of the Puget Sound.  </td><td>What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.
